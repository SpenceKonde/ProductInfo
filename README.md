# Product Info
This repository is the official source for information on products sold by [Azduino](https://www.tindie.com/stores/drazzy/), my Tindie store. All official information will be contained here; the old official website information pages will be shut down, and Azduino.com will serve to host a small number of files that need to be hosted on my own server, but mostly redirect to here. 

### Issues are enabled here 
**Please do not hesitate to open one** if you find inaccurate information here, or if a product is not adequately described here. Of course you can also email me (spencekonde@gmail.com) or use the Tindie messaging system. This is preferred for documentation or product page problems. Issues are publically viewable - to protect your privacy, please use email or Tindie message for problems with an order (Tindie message has the benefit of being viewable by Tindie support staff in case you are not satisfied with my response and feel a need to escalate; I strive for customer satisfaction, and this has rarely happened in the history of my store)



# AVR breakout and development boards
We sell a breakout and development board for nearly every part supported by the Arduino cores that I maintain. While the cores - of course - can be used without one of these official breakout boards, in many cases there is no readily available general purpose breakout/development board on the market. These provide a route by which hobbyists can take advantage of the unique features of these parts, and users who plan to design their own hardware (a common situation) can perform initial prototyping without having to design and build a board just to connect to the part and perform initial development. 

More development boards are coming by year end 2022 - an AVR128DB64 based board, an AVR128DB32-based nano-shaped board and a larger, AVR128DB48-based version, as well as at least one new product based on the AVR DD-series parts. 

See our [**AVR Breakout Board page**](AVRBreakouts.md) for more information.

## Prototyping Board
... pending. Many products are already for sale on Tindie - and more are comng!


## MOSFETs
We sell a number of breakout boards with 4 "beefy" MOSFETs mounted on them; we specialize in boards equipped with moderrn MOSFETs that can be turned on with low gate voltages - in contrast to most of the units for sale on ebay, aliexpress, and similar. Often, despite being marketed to Arduino hobbyists, these are not event rated for use with a logic level gate, but rather are "standard voltage" (~10V on gate required to reach headline specs)! I routinely hear about people using those mass-produced MOSFET boards, and getting performance more typical of 1989s era BJTs doe that reason. 

We also sell SOT-23 MOSFETs on tiny little breakout boards - it is truly a testament to modern semiconductor technolagy that a rice-grain sized transistor can switch a 6 amp load at under 20 mOhm on-state resistance, in response to only a couple of volts on it's gate!

See [**MOSFET product page**](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ProductInfo/tree/master/MOSFETs) for more information (note - the product listing page is yet to be written, only the sizing guide is ready. 

## Special Orders
We can do special orders (such as a different part or parts mounted on one of our breakout boards) as well as custom design work. Email SpenceKonde@gmail.com for more information.
